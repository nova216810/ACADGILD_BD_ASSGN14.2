Problem Statement
---Fetch date and temperature from temperature_data where zip code is greater than 300000 and less than 399999.
select date, temperature from temperature_data where zipcode between '300000' and '399999';

---Calculate maximum temperature corresponding to every year from temperature_data table.
select substr(date,7) as year , max(temperature) from temperature_data group by substr(date,7);

----Calculate maximum temperature from temperature_data table corresponding to those years which have at least 2 entries in the table.
select substr(date,7) as year, max(temperature) from temperature_data  group by substr(date,7) having count(substr(date,7))>2;

--Create a view on the top of last query, name it temperature_data_vw.
create view temperature_data_vw as select substr(date,7) as year, max(temperature) from temperature_data  group by substr(date,7) having count(substr(date,7))>2;

---Export contents from temperature_data_vw to a file in local file system, such that each file is '|' delimited.
INSERT OVERWRITE LOCAL DIRECTORY '/data/'
ROW FORMAT DELIMITED
FIELDS TERMINATED BY '|'
SELECT * FROM temperature_data_vw;
